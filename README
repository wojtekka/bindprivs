intro:
    this little silly kernel module can be used to restrict virtual host
    to some particular users. read bindprivs.conf(5) and bpset(8) for
    more details.

rmmod issue:
    before removing the module, you have to use ,,bpset -u'', wait until
    it is unused (see lsmod's result) and then use ,,rmmod''. if after
    unusually long time the module is still used, try to look for some
    network-related processes, strace(1) them and check which ones are
    stuck on some socketcall like accept(), connect(), send() or recv().
    then kill them.

compilation:
    if you get lots of errors about conflicting types, add ,,#define
    _LOOSE_KERNEL_NAMES'' at top of bindprivs.c

contact:
    DON'T contact me if you haven't read these docs or your system is
    broken. if you don't know how to deal with this package, you probably
    shouldn't be using it, or else you could get hurt. if you've found
    some mistake, some bug or some strange behaviour, feel free to write.

changelog:
    - 0.4 (2002-05-25)
        + no one complained, so moving to stable.
    - 0.4-beta1 (2002-05-08)
	+ kernel tree 2.4 is now supported as well as 2.2.
	+ changed behaviour to check the address before connect(), not while
	  bind()ing. it makes possible to deny even the default address, which
	  is 0.0.0.0/32.
	+ before unloading the module, you should run ,,bpset -u'' to release
	  all future socket operations.
	+ some framework for forcing the address. disabled by default.
	+ updated docs.
